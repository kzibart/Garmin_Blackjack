Garmin Connect IQ Game Blackjack

It's Blackjack!  Play anywhere, on the go!  And best of all, it's completely free!

Blackjack is a card game where you try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, while also beating the dealer's hand.  Place your bet, then deal the cards.  Decide whether to hit or stand, or split if you have matching cards.  Then see how the dealer did and whether you won or lost!

Betting:
Tap a bet amount to add that much to your bet.
Tap Clear to reset your bets.
Tap Deal to deal the cards after placing a bet.

Playing:
Tap Hit to draw another card.
Tap Stand to keep your hand as is.
Tap Split if you have matching cards and want to split your hand.
Split hands are played one at a time, starting with the left hand.
The hand being played has larger cards on the screen.

Payouts:
If your hand's value is 21, you win 1.5x your bet.
If your hand beats the dealer's you win 1x your bet.
If you bust or the dealer beats you, you lose your bet.
If your hand matches the dealer's, your bet is pushed to the next round.
Pushed amounts show as blue on the screen and count as part of the next hand's bet.

Settings:
Theme: Outlines, Outlines with shadows, Solids, Solids with shadows
Background: Green, Blue, Red, Black
Stats: Show statistics (wins, losses, streaks)

Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points.  Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.  Each hand's point value is displayed below it.  The dealer always hits on 16 or less and stands on 17 or more.  If you bust, you lose, even if the dealer also busts.

You start with $1,000.  See how long you can make it last and how much you can make it grow!  If you lose it all, don't worry, you can reset the game back to the initial $1,000.

I made this game for fun and share it freely.  Find my other Garmin apps, or leave me a tip, at this link:
